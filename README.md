**MSP**, or Movie Search by Plot, employs semantic-based search techniques to identify relevant movies. Unlike traditional search algorithms that rely on similarity measures, MSP understands the plot of a story, allowing users to find titles that match their actual interests.

Let's see some example:
```
Input: Adventure of scientist in his regular life
Result: The Creeping Flesh

Input: Horror love story
Result: Terror in the Aisles
```
